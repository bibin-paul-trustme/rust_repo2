# Rustup components availability tool

A library and some binaries to monitor rustup components availability history
on different platforms.

## The library part

Please refer to [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/rustup-available-packages) for more info on
the library, and to the source code of the binary crate for usage hints.

## The Web part

Under the `web` directory you will find a binary crate that's capable of
producing web-pages like
[https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup-components-history/](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup-components-history/).

Run the binary with a `--help` flag to see available options.

More info is coming :)

## The Terminal part

Under the `term` directory you will find a binary crate that you can use
directly from you favourite shell. The `--help` flag is also available.

More info is coming as well :)
