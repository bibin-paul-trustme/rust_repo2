# A path where a file tree of available packages will be created.
# The tool will generate a set of files under a given *output* directory with the
# following pattern: file_tree_output/$target/$package, where $target stands for a target
# host architecture, like x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, and $package stands for a package
# name, like rls or rust-src. Each of those files will contain a date in a "%Y-%m-%d"
# format (e.g. 2019-12-24) which represents the latest date when the package was (is)
# available for that specific target.
